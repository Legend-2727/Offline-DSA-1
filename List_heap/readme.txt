1.MyList by ArrayBasedOffline.cpp   --->     Array implementation of MyList
2.MyList by LinkedBasedOffline.cpp  --->     LinkedList implementation of MyList
3.Main.cpp                          --->     Containing the main function for the demonstration of
                                             the mentioned 13 method-functions of MyList
4.LRU.cpp                     --->      implementation of LRUCache using only MyList functions, it also
                                             contains the main function for itself.




	Note: Please comment out either "MyArrayList<data_type>" or "MyLinkedList<data_type>" instantiate
	      lines in the main function of Main.cpp and in the constructor of LRU.cpp in order to 
	      demonstrating the Array and LinkedList implementation respectively.
